# LASER Base - Home for LASER Disease Modeling Packages

Welcome to the home of the LASER disease modeling packages.

Documentation can be found [here](https://laser-base.github.io/laser-generic/) or you might start with a few of our generic (SI/SIR/SEIR etc.) model explorations [here](https://laser-base.github.io/laser-generic/tutorials/).

If you have access to GitHub Codespaces, feel free to open this repository in a Codespace (we recommend a 4-core or 8-core codespace) and run the notebooks under docs/tutorials/notebooks for yourself.
